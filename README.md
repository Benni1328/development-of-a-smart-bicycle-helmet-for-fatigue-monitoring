# development-of-a-smart-bicycle-helmet-for-fatigue-monitoring
Prototype of a smart bicycle helmet to detect drowsiness in children sitting in bike seats. Combines sensors (camera, pulse, gyroscope, GSR) on Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms to evaluate fatigue indicators and improve safety through sensor fusion.
